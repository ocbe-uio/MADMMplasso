Description: This system allows one to model a multi-variate, multi-response
    problem with interaction effects. It combines the usual squared error loss
    for the multi-response problem with some penalty terms to encourage
    responses that correlate to form groups and also allow for modeling main and
    interaction effects that exit within the covariates.
    The optimization method employed is the Alternating Direction Method of
    Multipliers (ADMM). The implementation is based on the methodology
    presented on Quachie Asenso, T., & Zucknick, M. (2023)
    <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2303.11155>.
